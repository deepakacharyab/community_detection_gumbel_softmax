    Cluster a network into several modules
    using modularity maximization by spectral methods.

    Supports directed and undirected networks.
    Edge weights are ignored

    Parameters
    ----------
    network : nx.Graph or nx.DiGraph
        The network of interest
    refine: Boolean
        Whether refine the `s` vector from the initial clustering
        by repeatedly moving nodes to maximize modularity

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        A dictionary that saves membership.
