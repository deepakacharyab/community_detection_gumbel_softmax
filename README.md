-The folder dataset has all the datasets used in our experiments, and the dataset was downloaded from konect. 

-The folder CDCGS has all the experiments performed to find the community and cluster them.

-The folder dataset_modularity_calculation is used to calculate the modularity measure for different algorithms.

-- Inside dataset_modularity_calculation run the modularity_calc.R to calculate the modularity measure for different algorithms.
